## Overview

R package `s2net`

 + Our method extends the supervised elastic-net problem, and thus it is a practical solution to the problem of feature selection in semi-supervised contexts.
 + Its mathematical formulation is presented from a general perspective, covering a wide range of models. 
 + We develop a flexible and fast implementation for `s2net` in `R`, written in `C++` using `RcppArmadillo` and integrated into `R` via `Rcpp` modules.


## Installation

You can install the released version of `s2net` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("s2net")
```

The development version can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jlaria/s2net")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
