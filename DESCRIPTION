Description: This package features the generalized semi-supervised elastic-net. This method extends the supervised elastic-net problem, and thus it is a practical solution to the problem of feature selection in semi-supervised contexts. Its mathematical formulation is presented from a general perspective, covering a wide range of models.  We focus on linear and logistic responses, but the implementation could be easily extended to other losses ingeneralized linear models. We develop a flexible and fast implementation, written in C++ using RcppArmadillo and integrated into R via Rcpp modules.
